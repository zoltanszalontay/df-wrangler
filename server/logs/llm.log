Using the Titanic dataset, calculate survival rates per cabin deck. Use the first letter of the cabin number to define the deck. Map decks in physical order (A=1 highest, B=2, …, G=7 lowest, T special case). Report survival rates by deck as percentages, include passenger counts, and compute the correlation between deck order (numeric) and survival rates. Also, note if any decks have very few passengers (e.g. G or T).
